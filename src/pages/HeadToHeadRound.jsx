QUESTIONS:

True or false. There will be a super over.
Pace or spin. What will take more wickets?
Bat or chase. Captains will choose to do either more?
Bat first or chase. Which will win more games?
Who wins. India or Pakistan or Game cancelled 

Consider using radio buttons or an even more preferable alternative like:

Two components available:

1. **RoundTitle Component**
2. **QuestionTitle Component**

The "Round" should be implemented as a <Card /> component. 
Apply sx={{ my: 2 }} styling to it, similar to how it's done for the "EnglandRound" and "StandingsRound".
